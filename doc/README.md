The goal of this documentation is to give the reader a global understanding of the guiding principles behind the design of Dropfactory. We also aim to provide a more detailed understanding of how all the components in this repository work together.

## Principles

An oil-in-water experiments consist of placing small oil droplets (made from an arbitrary mixture of oils) at the surface of an aqueous medium (made from a mixture of aqueous phases), we then need to video record the droplet movements to later analyse then.

To be able to run continuously such experiments, the platform must be able to mix, sample, clean and dry both oils and aqueous phases. Previous design had to do all such step in sequence, Dropfactory does them in parallel. Do do so the platform is organized as a little factory, enabling to fully parallelize all required operations (mixing, droplet placing, recording, cleaning, drying).

To achieve this, we designed the platform around three important mechanisms:

- a [XYZ CNC frame](cnc_frame.md) that provides the both the structural frame and the mechanism to move the syringe around as required to sample oil mixture and place droplets.
- two [geneva wheels](geneva_wheel.md), one for the oils, one for the aqueous phase. They allow to move the containers from one working station to another in a simple and robust way.
- [working stations](working_stations) that perform only one simple task. The vials and dishes are displaced to the working station thanks to the Geneval wheels. Having specialized working station makes the all system easier to design, build, and fix. In addition, a lot less cables and tubes will be in motion, reducing again the possibility of failure in the system.

In addition, we made a point to not over-design or over-specify the platform before building it. Rather we left ourselves room for iterating on the platform while building it and as we encountered problems. For example, most working stations have been redesigned 2 or 3 times after receiving real-world feedback from practical experience. To achieve this flexibility we based most of our design on [3D printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) combined with [aluminium profile](http://ooznest.co.uk/V-Slot) technology - enabling us to tune the system on site. This also explain why there is not overall 3D design specifying every details of the platform down to the last millimetres. Dropfactory has been conceived with modularity in mind and we hope the interested reader will adopt a similar approach if willing to build its own robot based on our design.

Below are links with more details on each sub-part of Dropfactory:

- [XYZ CNC frame](cnc_frame.md) contains information needed to build and control the XYZ system.
- [Geneva Wheel](geneva_wheel.md) explains how we designed our geneva wheel system, where are the 3D files and where is the code controlling it.
- [Modular Linear Actuator](modular_linear_actuator.md) details our small modular syringe system that is used at several places in the platform (syringe + some working stations).
- [Pumps](pumps.md) explain which pump we are using and how we control them.
- [Working Stations](working_stations) holds all the information about the deisgn of each working station in the platform.
