## Geneva Wheels

Two Geneva wheels (1 for the oil, 1 for the aqueous phase) are at the center of the [XYZ CNC frame](cnc_frame.md), they enable to mechanically move the containers to their working station.

### Principle

The mechanism driving a Geneva wheel provides a robust way to precisely turn a plateau step by step for a given angle from a continuous motion of the driving motor. Importantly, the plateau is mechanically locked into position between each turn. The principle is visualized in the animation below.

### Design

We designed our Geneva wheel system to be modular, compact, and at the same scale as our aluminium profile system, that is by multiple of 20mm.

The basic Geneva module utilizes a stepper motor that rotates the driving wheel. The rotating shaft/plateau is dimensioned to have 8 steps per turn and has some fixation patterns enabling to mount different types of plateau on top of the wheel.

We designed two plateaus, one for handling the oil containers and one for holding the petri dishes.

Finally, to improve the smoothness of the motion we designed a stabilizer that comes into contact with both wheel and dampens possible jerks in the wheel motion. The stabilizer is made of two bearings on a sliding axis that are pushed against one another and contact with the side of the Geneva wheels, providing a slight damping that is enough to stabilize the motion.

The code controlling the synchronous rotation of both wheels is in the [software/robot/robot.py](../software/robot/robot.py) file, more specifically the `rotate_geneva_wheels()` function. That function first makes sure nothing is in the way of the Geneva wheels, then moves the driving stepper motor one full turn, which in turn produces a 1/8 rotation of the plateau. We ensure thhat the stepper actually does one turn by using a homing switch and raise an error if the stepper does not reach the switch within 30 seconds, indicating that the system got stuck somehow.
