## Dish Filling

This station simple holds some tubes on top of the position 1 of the aqueous wheel.

In most of our experiments we used only one aqueous phase of TTAB at PH 13.

### Code

The code managing the dish filling working station is here: [software/working_station/fill_petri_dish.py](../../software/working_station/fill_petri_dish.py).

It simply normalizes the quantity given in the experiment description file (see [software](../../software)) and fills the dish with the given ratios of each aqueous phase given their associated pump and for the defined volume.
