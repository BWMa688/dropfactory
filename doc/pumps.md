## Pumps

The platform needs to handle various liquids such as oils, aqueous phases and acetone. Our group is using [Tricontinent C-Series Syringe Pumps](https://www.tricontinent.com/products/syringe-pumps-and-rotary-valves/c-series-syringe-pumps.html). Dropfactory uses 10 of them.

Here is a top view of the pumps and the reageant containers:

### Pump control

A full documentation of our python library to control the pumps and how to wire them is available at: https://github.com/croningp/pycont

For Dropfactory, the pumps configuration and control is managed in the [software/pump](../software/pump) folder.

### Pumps details

A pump is made of a syringe, whose volume can vary, and a valve that can dispatch the liquid from different directions.
