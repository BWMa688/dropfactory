## Modular Linear Actuator

A full documentation of our small modular linear actuator is available on the following repository: https://github.com/croningp/ModularSyringeDriver

The appeal of this device is its modularity. Many different additions can be designed and printed as can be seen on the illustration below:

This actuator is used multiple times in Dropfactory in:

- the [syringe system](working_stations/syringe.md)
- the [oil filling station](working_stations/oil_filling.md)
- the [oil cleaning station](working_stations/oil_cleaning.md)
- the [dish cleaning station](working_stations/dish_cleaning.md)
